		<h1>Site Purpose</h1>
		
		<p> 	The purpose of the <em>"Accountability and Goal Setting"</em> website is to give people resources to accomplish goals and help keep people on track for successful outcomes.
		   By creating the site in a different way than the competitors, the site can allow the success for people at a higher rate.  This website should be able to generate revenue 
		in time, and will serve to donate money to charities.  The overall style and structure of the website should be overall easier to use and simple as possible. 
		Once they have committed to a goal, people are less likely to give up.  The notion that they do not want a negative consequence (promise note being broken)
		should allow people to reach their goals.
		</p><br><br>
					
	
	
		<h1>Needs Analysis</h1>
		
		<p> The site will contain information on the following topics:.</p>
			<ul>
				<li> Different ways how to improve fitness and stay in shape.</li>
				<li> What are good ways to live within your budget and save money?</li>
				<li> How to improve relationships with significant others. </li>
				<li> What are some ways to grow your career? </li>
				<li> Where can you find more purpose in your life? </li>
				<li> Provide tools to enhance the above improvements in a practical manner.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>  The site will have a lot of content related to what other people have done before to address some common life issues.
			The information that will be available should be of consistent format, and have a fresh and clean look.  The website should be able to 
			give people enter goals into the website and deposit promise notes to keep them on track of their goals.  The website should have the ability to send emails, texts, and calendar functionality.
			The whole idea is that people can use this site to get automated coaching prompts and continuously remind people of their goals.  </p><br><br>
	
	
	
		<h1>Goals</h1>
		
		<p> The site will complete the following functions:.</p>
			<ul>
				<li> Contain a variety of information and success stories on different life goals and how people have successfuly achieved them.  </li>
				<li> Allow users to join the site, log in, and write down their goals and put timelines associated with them</li>
				<li> Allow the user to get texts and emails about their progress </li>
				<li> Allow the user to put a promisary note or real money into an account for enhanced accountability </li>
				<li> Create a blog that shows different user's goals and provides sense of community </li>
			</ul>
		<p> I understand that the goals above are stretch goals based on the experience of this introductary class so far.  I thought about this being a good way to really strecth my understanding of websites
			in general.  If I don't get the entire goal set above, I'd like to have the site as self contained and clean as possible.  Part of this project is goal setting, so I'm glad to expand on 
			my understanding by jumping with both feet in on complex web functions.</p><br><br>
	
	
	
		<h1>Audience Characteritics</h1>
		
		<p> The primary audience here is anyone that is interested resources that can help people achieve goals.  This includes anyone from any age that wants to improve themselves.  The secondary
		audience could be anyone that is a coach, and wants to share a common remote workspace with their client.  This allows access anywhere in the world, and can be considered an objective 3rd party
		to serve information and motivating messages.</p><br><br>
					
	
	
			<h1>Competition</h1>
		
		<p> The competition here are the other 2 websites that I mentioned in the project proposal.  StickK and HealthyWage are two very interesting platforms that each have their own audience.  
		I want my website to be a more general platform for different challenges that people struggle with.  I want to have more informative content than the StickK site, and more simple negative 
		consequences than the HealthyWage as well as the positive reinforcement aspect.  These sites serve as great ideas to start with, and I want to really expand on the sites to give users more information
		and more flexible experiences.</p><br><br>
