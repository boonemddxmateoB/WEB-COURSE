    <h1>Traditional glucose metabolism</h1>
    <p>The regular process of metabolism involves consuming food to produce to glucose.
	The brain and muscles in your body can utilize glucose for energy needs for thinking, moving, and surviving.  The body gets glucose from carboydrates 
	typically.  The body converts the sugar in foods to glucose that our bodies can use.  Any any extra glucose is stored in fat cells as fatty acids.  
	The body uses a lot of insulin to break down sugar in the blood to convert to glucose.  
	</p><br><br><br>
	<img src="KetoSite/glucose.jpg" alt="glucose"><br><br><br>
	<h2>High carbohydrates and insulin sensitivity </h2>
    <p>When the body takes in food with higher carbohydrate or sugar content, there 
	is a spike of insuline repsonse.  This causes the excess glucose to be converted to fat, 
	and a drop in blood sugar.  This typical crash happens and people feel tired 
	or cranky often.  Over time, if the body produces insulin at this much higher load it can become insulin insensitive.
	The insulin insensitivity will require larger and larger amounts of insulin either from the pancreas or from injections to keep the blood glucose stable.
	The body will try to compensate for this lower sensitivity by increasing the total amount of insuslin that it produces.  This hyperinsulinemia is 
	associated with damage to blood vessels, high blood pressure, heart disease, heart failure, osteoporosis, cancer, and obesity.  Low insulin sensitivity, 
	or insulin resistance is associated with type 2 diabetes. 
	</p><br><br><br>
    <h3>Impaired glucose tolerance</h3>
    <p> The body can become overworked and stop producing enough insulin over time to keep up with this 
	ever rising need from the body for more insulin.  This means that the glucose (sugar) in the blood is too high, and that the body cells are insensitive to the insulin.  
	At pre-diabetic levels, the pancreas begins to become overloaded, and cannot produce insulin to match the body's needs.
	When the pancreas cannot keep up with demand, the person will probably need insulin therapy.  However, in 75% of cases this
	disease can be controlled through diet and exercise.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br>

	<h1>What is Ketosis ?</h1>
    <p>Ketosis is a different method of metobolism for humans.  This involves using Ketone bodies for brain activities in addition to glucose.  
	People on a ketogenic diet describe the benefit of clearer thinking throughout the day, more energy, less brain fog, and overall better feeling.
	The traditional ketone bodies are: </p>
		<ul> 
			<li><span class="ketone">Acetoacetate acid</span></li>
			<li><span class="ketone">Beta Hydroxy Butyrate</span></li>
			<li><span class="ketone">Acetone</span></li>
		</ul>

   <h2>Ketogenic Diet and metabolism</h2>
	<p>The ketogenic diet will use the alternative ketone bodies for brain function.  A diet that is ketogenic usually consists of 5% carbohydrate,
	20% protein, and 75% fat by weight.  The idea behind this is that the body will transition to burning fat directly through the liver.  The liver will break 
	down the stored fatty acids and give the body the needed fuel.  When the body is in a carbohydrate restricted state for a long period, it naturally shifts to 
	this type of a metabolism to prevent the body from shutting down starting at the brain.  The brain can only use glucose or ketones directly.  Without glucose, 
	the liver turns the stored body fat into fuel.  When you consume fat instead of carbohydrates, your body produces much less insulin.  The transition to a high fat 
	diet is accompanied by more even and lower insulin levels throughout the day.  You also have a nice steady supply of energy throughout the day.  Your body learns to 
	access the fat stores and will burn more fat than traditional glucose metabolism.  The biggest benefits come from the lower cravings for food throughout the day, 
	eating food with higher fat is tasty :), you have more energy and mental clarity, and it is easy to lose weight on it.</p>

    <h3>Common mistakes and pitfalls on Ketogenic Diets</h3>
    <p>A lot of the issues that arise from this different source of nutrition are just being aware of pitfalls and mistakes.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Increased Sodium , Potassium , and Magnesium need</li>
			<li>Not drinking enough water</li>
			<li>Not watching all food intake closely enough</li>
			<li>Counting Net Carbohydrates</li>
		</ul>
	<p>Initially, during the transition phase the body drops a significant amount of water weight along with sodium, potassium, and magnisium.
	This can lead to a shortage of electrolytes and is described as the keto flu.  To combat this, make sure that you take in daily sodium, potassium, and magnisium.<br><br>
	
	The ketogenic diet requires a lot of water, and you should be drinking at least 6-8 glasses a day of it to avoid dehydration.<br><br>
	You might think that you have a good idea of the carbohydrate content of your food, but unless you watch closely there are always foods that will surprise you.
	A lot of food manufactures add high fructose corn syrup and flour to food for increased palatability.  I suggest <a href="https://www.myfitnesspal.com/">myfitnesspal</a>
	as an easy site/app to track food intake.You need to understand that the net effective carbohydrates in foods are not directly listed on nutrition labels.  <br><br>
	You only have to count the net carbs (total carbs minus dietary fiber).  This is important when monitoring the food that you consuming.  For example if a food contains 10 grams of 
	total carbs, but has 8 grams of dietary fiber (not digestable fiber) then the net effective carbs are 2 grams.</p><br>
